# AI-Smart-Parking-Finder
The Smart AI Parking Finder is an intelligent parking assistance system built using Python and Tkinter, designed to help users find the most efficient parking slot within a parking area.
It simulates a real-world smart parking system by integrating AI pathfinding algorithms (like A* and BFS) with an interactive graph-based visualization of the parking layout.

This project aims to optimize vehicle movement inside parking zones, reduce congestion, and improve user experience through real-time path visualization and decision-making.

Features

🧠 AI-Powered Pathfinding – Uses A* and BFS algorithms to calculate the shortest route between parking slots.
🎨 Interactive GUI – Developed using Tkinter for easy slot selection and path visualization.
🟩 Dynamic Visualization – Displays parking grid as a connected graph with available and occupied slots in different colors.
🔁 Real-Time Updates – Path and visualization update instantly when a new destination is selected.
🕹️ User Interaction – Click to select current and desired parking slots, and watch the animated traversal.
🚘 Smart Slot Allocation – Highlights available and occupied spots dynamically.


How It Works

1.Run the project using python main.py.
2.A visual grid of parking slots appears (green = available, red = occupied).
3.Select your current position and desired parking slot by clicking.
4.The system computes and animates the optimal path.
5.Selecting a new target recalculates and displays the updated route dynamically.


Real-Life Applications

1.Smart city parking management systems.
2.Automated car park guidance systems.
3.IoT-integrated vehicle routing for large parking complexes.
4.Traffic optimization inside malls, airports, and stadiums.
